# Retail Performance Audit: Salty Snacks Variety Pack Optimization

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive 52-week longitudinal study of the **Salty Snacks Variety Pack** category using retail data ending February 7, 2026. The analysis focuses on identifying performance variances between a selected three-tier competitive aggregate (National, Private Label, and Regional brands) and the broader category market.

## Business Context
The Salty Snacks Variety Pack category is a multi-billion dollar segment currently navigating significant market shifts. Leveraging my background as a Mathematics and Statistics Instructor, I utilized this project to model shelf-space productivity and seasonal consumer behavior to support strategic retail decisions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Total Category Sales**: Represents the $3.1 Billion total market for Salty Snacks Variety Packs.
* **Focus Product Sales**: Represents the $64.9 Million aggregate sales of Frito-Lay, Private Label, and Herr’s brands (about 2% of total market).
* **Velocity ($/TDP)**: A measure of shelf-space efficiency, interpreted as the revenue generated per point of distribution.
* **Total Distribution Points (TDP)**: A metric reflecting the total shelf presence and availability across the retail landscape.

## Executive Summary of Findings
* **Category vs. Portfolio Variance**: While the total category experienced a **-6.2%** year-over-year decline, the focus brand aggregate achieved a significant **+25.7%** growth.
* **Seasonal Elasticity**: The analysis identified a high degree of seasonal variance, specifically a **+296.2%** growth peak during the week of June 14, 2025.
* **Shelf Efficiency Trough**: Velocity analysis revealed a **44% decline** in shelf productivity between the July peak ($17,485) and the January trough ($9,810).

## Platform Validation (NIQ Byzzer)
Data was extracted and initially validated using the NIQ Byzzer retail analytics platform. The dashboard snapshot below confirms the macro-level divergence between the category decline and the focus portfolio growth.

### 2. Shelf Productivity (Velocity)
This chart tracks the revenue generated per point of distribution. It illustrates that while distribution levels remained stable, the "return on shelf space" fluctuated significantly by season.

## Strategic Recommendations
* **Dynamic Shelf Allocation**: Reallocate 10-15% of variety pack shelf space during January to higher-velocity categories (e.g., wellness or "New Year" snacks) to mitigate the identified 44% decline in snack velocity.
* **Promotional Timing**: Synchronize high-volume promotional spend with the identified mid-June peak to capitalize on maximum consumer demand.
* **Private Label Expansion**: Given the +25.7% growth of the focus aggregate, consider expanding Private Label facings to capture market share from declining lower-tier competitors.

## Technical Methodology
* **Data Sourcing**: Utilized NIQ Byzzer to extract 52 weeks of longitudinal retail data.
* **Data Auditing**: Performed a comparative audit of raw unit sales versus dollar sales to identify pricing and promotional impacts.
* **Efficiency Modeling**: Used the Velocity ($/TDP) metric to evaluate the financial productivity of retail "real estate" (shelf space).
